## Problem
The goal of this software is to help people with hearing disability. For these people
sometimes it can be hard to hear when somebody rings at the door, especially since most
of the doorbells are using high frequency tones.
## Solution
Everyone has a smartphone. And most the time the smartphone is nearby the owner. So this
device can be used to inform the person about somebody who ringed at the door. Since
there are many hearing aids which are connected to the smartphone to make a sound when a
push notification arrived the phone, it is the optimal way to forward the doorbell signal
to the person.

The solution of the problem could be that when somebody uses the doorbell a push notification
is sent onto the smartphone of the people with the hearing disability. For best practise
the person should use hearing aids which are connected to the smartphone.
